# Alexandria-Hermes

Alexandria-Hermes is a FastAPI + MCP backend for agent long-term memory, memory compaction, Obsidian Markdown storage, and librarian collaboration.

The previous Next.js frontend, standalone product CLI, and SQLite-backed skill/prompt/harness CRUD surfaces have been removed. Obsidian Markdown is the human-facing source of truth; PostgreSQL is the operational, lexical-search, and pgvector retrieval store.

```text
Obsidian Markdown = canonical notes people can read and edit
PostgreSQL = operational state + rebuildable lexical/vector search indexes
Neo4j = rebuildable graph projection
Alexandria-Hermes = FastAPI backend + MCP endpoint
Librarian = optional Obsidian-aware collaborator/chat pane
```

## Current scope

Alexandria-Hermes now focuses on a narrow MCP-first recall surface:

- FastAPI backend on `127.0.0.1:8000`
- Streamable HTTP MCP endpoint at `POST /mcp/`
- Minimal package CLI for launching MCP and checking librarian readiness
- MCP tools for Context Vault recall, RAG Context Packs, Memory Compact lookup, librarian collaboration, Obsidian note search/read/save, and skill-acquisition jobs
- PostgreSQL-backed operational storage for provider profiles, OAuth state, librarian jobs, workflow checkpoints, and rebuildable Obsidian/Context lexical and pgvector indexes
- Obsidian-backed Markdown notes under `SERVICE_OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH`
- Optional local Obsidian plugin at `integrations/obsidian/alexandria-librarian/`

Removed legacy surfaces stay removed by contract tests:

- Next.js/frontend runtime and frontend CI
- standalone product/operator CRUD CLI commands
- SQLite library item CRUD, category/folder management, and `app/library` package code
- SQLite-backed skill/prompt/harness CRUD
- MinIO/object-storage archive/import/provider/health surfaces
- public Context Vault lint/manual-save routes

## Quick start

Store the Compose database settings in the gitignored project `.env`. Compose
does not contain database passwords or construct `DATABASE_URL` from tracked
defaults:

```dotenv
ALEXANDRIA_POSTGRES_DB=alexandria
ALEXANDRIA_POSTGRES_USER=postgres
ALEXANDRIA_POSTGRES_PASSWORD=replace-with-a-private-local-password
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://alexandria:replace-with-a-private-local-password@alexandria-postgres:5432/alexandria
```

Compose maps the private `ALEXANDRIA_POSTGRES_*` values into the official
PostgreSQL container's `POSTGRES_*` variables. The backend reads `DATABASE_URL`
directly and normalizes generic `postgresql://` or `postgres://` schemes to the
installed asyncpg SQLAlchemy driver. Keep the URL database, user, password, and
the Compose network host `postgres` consistent with those values.

Run the backend with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

### PostgreSQL backup and restore drill

PostgreSQL backup remains process-external by design. The FastAPI backup route
continues to serve only the legacy local-SQLite mode; the PostgreSQL runtime
uses `pg_dump`, encrypted manifests, and an isolated temporary restore database
without granting Docker or restore privileges to the API process.

Set a private passphrase in the local shell, create an encrypted backup, and
then verify it with a non-destructive restore drill:

```bash
export ALEXANDRIA_POSTGRES_BACKUP_PASSPHRASE='replace-with-a-private-passphrase'
./scripts/postgres-backup.sh
./scripts/postgres-restore-drill.sh <backup-id-or-backup-directory>
unset ALEXANDRIA_POSTGRES_BACKUP_PASSPHRASE
```

The version-2 backup manifest records the Alembic revision, public-table count,
pgvector presence, and plaintext/encrypted hashes. The restore drill requires
those invariants to match and confirms that its temporary database was removed
before publishing a `VERIFIED` report. This archive covers PostgreSQL only;
back up the canonical Obsidian Vault and `backend/data/.alexandria-recovery`
with the host filesystem policy as separate durable assets.

Neo4j graph read-model support is optional and disabled by the default Compose
profile. To start the backend plus local-only Neo4j for graph projection work,
add `ALEXANDRIA_NEO4J_PASSWORD` with a private local value to the gitignored
project `.env`, then enable the `graph` profile. Compose intentionally provides
no password fallback and refuses to start the graph profile when the variable
is absent:

```bash
docker compose --profile graph up --build
```

Stop the optional graph profile with:

```bash
docker compose --profile graph down
```

Neo4j is a rebuildable graph projection target, not canonical storage. Obsidian
Markdown remains the human-editable source of truth, while PostgreSQL stores
operational state and the rebuildable note, edge, lexical, and pgvector indexes.
PostgreSQL `obsidian_edges` rows are only a source cache for explicit Neo4j
projection rebuilds; graph evidence, lineage, traversal, and impact reads are
Neo4j-only.

### Redis operational acceleration

Redis is an internal acceleration and delivery layer, not canonical storage and
not the cross-process lock authority. PostgreSQL advisory locks remain the final
maintenance exclusion boundary. The local Compose Redis instance uses AOF
`everysec`, a removable named volume, a 256 MiB cap, and `noeviction` so pending
Streams jobs are never silently discarded under memory pressure.

The first queued workload is embedding reindex: the API submits a deduplicated
Redis Streams job, one separate worker consumes at concurrency `1`, each job is
bounded to `250` chunks by default, and failures are retried up to `3` attempts
before a dead-letter entry is recorded. Queue submission is limited to `6` new
jobs per caller per `60` seconds, while identical manual/scheduler submissions
reuse the existing job for a `60` second cooldown.

Disposable status caches use the following TTLs: operational readiness `5`
seconds, graph projection status `5` seconds, and embedding health `10` seconds.
Direct outbound OpenAI calls consume a Redis fixed-window permit before network
activity; the default budget is `60` calls per provider-call scope per `60`
seconds. Redis failure disables queued maintenance and, by default, fails closed
for outbound provider calls, while canonical Markdown and PostgreSQL-backed core
memory remain independent.

The backend config selector `SERVICE_GRAPH_READ_MODEL` defaults to `disabled`
and also accepts `neo4j`. Disabled mode does not create a driver, verify
connectivity, open a session, or add graph-lane warnings to Context search
responses. PostgreSQL search and RAG remain available in disabled mode, but contain
no graph evidence, and related-note reads return service unavailable rather
than falling back to PostgreSQL or reporting a misleading empty graph. To opt into
the rebuildable projection adapter, store
the connection values it consumes in the gitignored project `.env`:

```dotenv
ALEXANDRIA_NEO4J_PASSWORD=replace-with-a-private-local-password
SERVICE_GRAPH_READ_MODEL=neo4j
SERVICE_NEO4J_URI=bolt://neo4j:7687
SERVICE_NEO4J_USERNAME=neo4j
SERVICE_NEO4J_PASSWORD=replace-with-the-same-private-local-password
SERVICE_NEO4J_DATABASE=neo4j
```

Keep the password in the gitignored project `.env`; never place it in tracked
Compose or documentation files. The adapter owns one async driver for its
application lifetime and creates a short-lived session for each explicit graph
operation. It does not run connectivity checks during default startup or
readiness, and no existing RAG path depends on it.

After enabling the graph profile, make sure the PostgreSQL schema is current, then
rebuild the canonical Obsidian/PostgreSQL index before rebuilding the optional Neo4j
projection:

```bash
cd backend
uv run alembic upgrade head
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/obsidian/index/rebuild
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/obsidian/graph/projection/rebuild
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/obsidian/graph/projection/status
```

The Neo4j projection reads from the PostgreSQL note/edge cache produced by Obsidian
reindexing. Running graph rebuild against a stale index can produce a technically
`ready` projection from stale source rows, so keep the `reindex -> graph rebuild
-> status` sequence together in local operations.

Graph rebuild responses are concise by default: `issue_total` and
`issue_counts` summarize non-fatal source diagnostics, while `errors` contains
only operation failures. Missing or ambiguous link targets are skipped instead
of being written into the active projection. Request a bounded sample only when
investigating diagnostics:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  'http://127.0.0.1:8000/obsidian/graph/projection/rebuild?include_issue_details=true&issue_limit=100'
```

Vault reindex, embedding rebuild/reindex, and graph projection rebuild share one
fail-fast maintenance lane. A competing maintenance request returns HTTP `409`;
retry it after the active operation finishes rather than running rebuilds in
parallel.

Neo4j stores the initially configured password in the `neo4j-data` named volume.
If you later change `ALEXANDRIA_NEO4J_PASSWORD` in `.env`, the container may fail
authentication against the existing volume. Either restore the previous local
password, or intentionally reset only the rebuildable Neo4j projection volume and
then run the reindex/rebuild sequence again. Do not delete the Obsidian vault or
PostgreSQL operational volume when resetting the optional graph projection.

Or run it locally from `backend/`:

```bash
cd backend
uv sync
uv run alembic upgrade head
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Required local secret:

```bash
export SERVICE_MCP_LOCAL_APPROVAL_KEY="replace-with-at-least-32-characters"
```

Docker Compose passes the gitignored project `.env` into the backend container.
Keep that file private and store deployment-specific secrets there rather than
duplicating application defaults in `docker-compose.yml`.

Useful Obsidian storage settings:

```bash
export SERVICE_OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH="$HOME/Desktop/Alexandria"
export SERVICE_ALEXANDRIA_OBSIDIAN_ROOT="."
export SERVICE_MEMORY_COMPACT_NOTE_DIR="Memory Compacts"
```

Use `SERVICE_ALEXANDRIA_OBSIDIAN_ROOT="."` when the vault itself is the Alexandria workspace. This avoids a nested `Alexandria/Alexandria` layout.

After the backend is running, verify the Memory Steward/Vault maintenance bridge with the
package CLI, not Makefile operational wrappers. Install/sync once, then use
`--no-sync` for parseable JSON stdout:

```bash
cd backend
make install-local
uv run --no-sync --no-editable alexandria-hermes memory-steward check \
  --project alexandria-hermes \
  --refresh-compact \
  --summary
```

The command returns parseable JSON and repairs only stale or missing CURRENT
Memory Compacts. A healthy local bridge returns `ok: true`, empty `warnings`,
healthy RAG fields, `review_queue_total: 0`, and a current compact id/age.
When attention is needed, the summary includes `next_actions_count`,
`next_action`, `next_action_tool`, `review_auto_move_candidates`, and
`review_manual_required` so an agent can choose the next safe maintenance
operation without reading a long diagnostic body.

## MCP endpoint

The FastAPI app exposes the Streamable HTTP MCP endpoint at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp/
```

Alexandria-Hermes supports three explicit MCP authentication modes:

- `none`: default localhost-only mode; no bearer token is required.
- `local_oauth2`: Alexandria runs its own Authorization Code + PKCE server,
  issues rotating access/refresh tokens, and asks the local operator to approve
  each connection in the browser.
- `oauth2`: Alexandria only verifies JWT bearer tokens issued by an external
  authorization server through issuer/audience/JWKS configuration.

The OpenAI Codex OAuth routes under `/settings/connections/{provider_id}/oauth/*`
serve a different direction: they authorize Alexandria to call a provider. MCP
OAuth authorizes ChatGPT or another MCP client to call Alexandria.

For the default `none` mode, keep the backend bound to `127.0.0.1` and connect
an MCP client directly to the URL above. No custom operator header is required.

To enable Alexandria-issued OAuth for a public HTTPS endpoint, configure:

```bash
export SERVICE_MCP_LOCAL_APPROVAL_KEY="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
export SERVICE_SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
export SERVICE_MCP_AUTH_MODE="local_oauth2"
export SERVICE_MCP_OAUTH_ISSUER="https://your-mcp-host.example"
export SERVICE_MCP_OAUTH_RESOURCE="https://your-mcp-host.example/mcp"
```

Then connect ChatGPT to:

```text
https://your-mcp-host.example/mcp
```

The client discovers `/register`, `/authorize`, `/token`, `/revoke`, and the
OAuth metadata automatically. During connection, Alexandria opens `/approve`;
open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/connect` on the backend host, create one pairing
code, and enter it on the approval page. Pairing codes are single-use and
short-lived. Authorization codes and access/refresh tokens are stored only as
SHA-256 lookup hashes; dynamic client secrets are encrypted with the configured
`SERVICE_SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY`.

Public hosts expose only the MCP/OAuth protocol routes and `/health/live`.
Operator surfaces such as `/connect`, `/settings/connections`, `/operations`,
API documentation, and ordinary backend REST routes remain localhost-only.
Use `http://127.0.0.1:8000/connect` for local administration; do not publish the
Hub itself as the MCP endpoint.

For an external OAuth/JWKS issuer instead, use `SERVICE_MCP_AUTH_MODE=oauth2`
and configure `SERVICE_MCP_OAUTH_ISSUER`, `SERVICE_MCP_OAUTH_AUDIENCE`, and
`SERVICE_MCP_OAUTH_JWKS_URL`.

After changing or reinstalling the backend, an MCP `tools/list` smoke check should
include the Memory Steward and Vault maintenance tools:

```bash
cd backend
uv run --no-sync --no-editable alexandria-hermes mcp smoke-tools
```

```text
alexandria_memory_steward_readiness
alexandria_memory_steward_refresh_current_compact
alexandria_vault_review_queue
alexandria_vault_review_move_plan
alexandria_vault_review_apply_moves
```

The Librarian agent-facing surface is intentionally smaller and capability-focused:

```text
alexandria_search_skills
alexandria_start_skill_acquisition
alexandria_skill_acquisition_job_status
```

Provider/profile selection, OAuth lifecycle, generic delegation, and manual skill completion are internal implementation details rather than requesting-agent MCP controls.

To check both MCP tool exposure and Memory Steward readiness in one script-friendly
JSON result, run:

```bash
cd backend
uv run --no-sync --no-editable alexandria-hermes memory-steward check \
  --project alexandria-hermes
```

For a status-only JSON result, including MCP endpoint/tool count, tool exposure,
required Memory Steward/Vault MCP tool names, RAG health, review queue total,
automatic/manual curation counts, the current compact id/age, and the first
recommended maintenance action, add `--summary`:

```bash
cd backend
uv run --no-sync --no-editable alexandria-hermes memory-steward check \
  --project alexandria-hermes \
  --summary
```

For startup automation that also repairs only stale or missing CURRENT compacts,
add `--refresh-compact`:

```bash
cd backend
uv run --no-sync --no-editable alexandria-hermes memory-steward check \
  --project alexandria-hermes \
  --refresh-compact \
  --summary
```

A minimal JSON-RPC initialize request for localhost `none` mode is:

```bash
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id":1,
    "method":"initialize",
    "params":{
      "protocolVersion":"2025-06-18",
      "capabilities":{},
      "clientInfo":{"name":"curl-smoke","version":"0.1.0"}
    }
  }'
```

## Memory Steward and Vault CLI

The package CLI is a Typer command package under `backend/app/cli/`. It includes
only operational commands that support the MCP-first maintenance workflow; it does
not restore the removed product CRUD CLI.

Run a one-shot readiness check against the local backend:

```bash
cd backend
uv run --no-sync --no-editable alexandria-hermes memory-steward readiness \
  --project alexandria-hermes
```

The response combines RAG health, CURRENT Memory Compact freshness, and the
vault review queue. A healthy second-brain bridge should return
`"status": "ready"`, an empty `warnings` list, and an empty `next_actions`
list. If attention is needed, `next_actions` gives deterministic priorities for
repairing retrieval, refreshing the CURRENT compact, planning safe vault moves
for automatic candidates, or inspecting notes that still require human
judgment. The embedded `review_queue` also separates automatic move candidates
from manual-review notes before applying changes.

Inspect the curation queue directly without changing the vault:

```bash
cd backend
uv run --no-sync --no-editable alexandria-hermes vault review-queue \
  --project alexandria-hermes \
  --summary
```

Build the non-mutating safe move plan for automatic candidates:

```bash
cd backend
uv run --no-sync --no-editable alexandria-hermes vault review-move-plan \
  --project alexandria-hermes
```

After inspecting the plan, apply the safe moves explicitly and write an
operation report. Direct CLI use must include `--confirm-apply` when the plan has
move candidates. The MCP apply tool follows the same default: it returns
`confirmation_required` unless `confirm_apply` is true for a non-empty plan.

```bash
cd backend
uv run --no-sync --no-editable alexandria-hermes vault review-apply-moves \
  --project alexandria-hermes \
  --confirm-apply
```

Review commands accept `--project`, `--limit`, and optional `--scope-path`; the
apply command also accepts optional `--report-path` and `--verification-query`.

Use preflight in scripts or agent startup checks. It prints the same JSON-shaped
readiness evidence, returns exit code `0` when ready, and returns exit code `2`
when Memory Steward still needs attention:

```bash
cd backend
uv run --no-sync --no-editable alexandria-hermes memory-steward preflight \
  --project alexandria-hermes
```

Plan a CURRENT Memory Compact refresh without mutating the vault:

```bash
cd backend
uv run --no-sync --no-editable alexandria-hermes memory-steward refresh-current-compact \
  --project alexandria-hermes
```

Apply the refresh only when the plan says `refresh_required: true`, or when an
operator intentionally passes `--force`:

```bash
cd backend
uv run --no-sync --no-editable alexandria-hermes memory-steward refresh-current-compact \
  --project alexandria-hermes \
  --apply
```

For a startup check that may repair only stale or missing CURRENT compacts, use:

```bash
cd backend
uv run --no-sync --no-editable alexandria-hermes memory-steward preflight \
  --project alexandria-hermes \
  --refresh-compact
```

This passes `--refresh-compact`, but it remains a no-op when the CURRENT compact
is already fresh (`refresh_required: false`, `created: null`). It only creates a
new CURRENT compact when readiness reports a missing, stale, or timestamp-less
compact. Use `--max-compact-age-days 14` to tighten freshness during a check.

## Obsidian plugin: librarian side pane

The optional local plugin lives at:

```text
integrations/obsidian/alexandria-librarian/
```

Copy or symlink that plugin into the target vault's `.obsidian/plugins/` folder during local plugin development. Then open Obsidian, enable Community plugins, enable **Alexandria Librarian**, and run the command palette action `Ask Alexandria Librarian`.

The pane defaults to **Whole vault** scope so the librarian searches indexed memory, skills, prompts, plans, and context notes before citing source notes. OAuth tokens remain in backend provider storage, not in Obsidian.

## Canonical memory, skills, and prompts

Reusable artifacts live as Obsidian notes, not database library rows. PostgreSQL keeps operational job and retrieval metadata, while the human-editable source of truth remains Markdown in the vault.

Memory Compact lifecycle APIs write Markdown under `SERVICE_MEMORY_COMPACT_NOTE_DIR`. Rebuild the Obsidian index with:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/obsidian/index/rebuild
```

If PostgreSQL retrieval indexes are rebuilt, Markdown can repopulate note, chunk, edge, lexical, and vector projections. Provider profiles, OAuth state, and job/workflow operational state are not derived from Markdown and require normal PostgreSQL backups.

## Graph edges, related notes, and workflows

Reindex rebuilds a PostgreSQL `obsidian_edges` source cache from relation frontmatter and body wikilinks. Obsidian Markdown remains canonical, and a full reindex can reconstruct the derived cache. This table does not serve graph traversal. Related-note traversal and graph evidence/lineage/impact reads use only the active Neo4j projection produced by the explicit graph rebuild endpoint. With `SERVICE_GRAPH_READ_MODEL=disabled`, PostgreSQL lexical/vector search and RAG still work without graph evidence and related-note endpoints return `503 Service Unavailable`.

HTTP/MCP additions include related-note retrieval and resumable LangGraph librarian workflows:

```text
GET  /obsidian/notes/by-path/related?path=<path>
GET  /obsidian/notes/{note_id}/related
POST /obsidian/librarian/workflows
GET  /obsidian/librarian/workflows/{thread_id}
POST /obsidian/librarian/workflows/{thread_id}/resume
POST /obsidian/librarian/workflows/{thread_id}/cancel
```

The workflow runtime uses stateless `langgraph` `StateGraph` phases around a
durable `obsidian_librarian_workflows` PostgreSQL row. Planning persists the
complete approval state before side effects; resume reconstructs the graph
state from that row and executes only approved actions. No separate LangGraph
SQLite checkpoint database is used.

## Local development

Backend development uses `uv` and the backend Makefile:

```bash
cd backend
uv sync
make format_check
make type_checking
make guardrails
make test
```

`make guardrails` is intentionally database-free. `make test` starts an
ephemeral localhost-only PostgreSQL/pgvector container on a random host port,
runs the full test suite against a session-owned test database, and removes the
container on exit. It does not depend on the runtime Compose `postgres` network
alias or the private repository `.env`.

The GitHub Actions parity gate is:

```bash
cd backend
make ci
```

`make ci` also runs a no-editable package CLI smoke check for both
`alexandria-hermes` and `alex-hermes`, then runs the same ephemeral-PostgreSQL
test contract used by the pre-push hook and GitHub Actions.

Health check:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health/live
```
