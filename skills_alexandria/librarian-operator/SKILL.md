description: Use when an agent needs a reusable capability that is missing from Alexandria. Search existing skills first; if insufficient, start an autonomous Librarian skill-acquisition job that researches authoritative sources, drafts and validates a reusable skill, publishes it to Obsidian, and returns a handoff to the requesting agent.

# Librarian Skill Acquisition

Alexandria Librarian is a focused **Skill Acquisition Agent**. It is not the general vault operator, memory compactor, OAuth controller, or catch-all research assistant.

## Responsibility boundary

```text
Requesting Agent
→ search existing skills
→ reuse when sufficient
→ otherwise start acquisition
→ Librarian researches and drafts
→ validate evidence and artifact
→ publish canonical Skill to Obsidian
→ reindex / verify
→ return durable handoff
→ requesting Agent resumes work
```

Other ownership boundaries:

- Alexandria Core owns vault search, note CRUD, graph, inventory, review, and safe moves.
- Memory Steward owns reconciliation, conflicts, Memory Compact lifecycle, and periodic compaction.
- Provider selection, credentials, and OAuth are internal execution details and are not agent-facing MCP controls.

## Public MCP contract

### 1. Search first

Use:

- `alexandria_search_skills(capability=..., task_goal=..., project=...)`

Pass the concrete missing capability, current task goal, environment, required tools, constraints, risk tolerance, and success criteria when known.

If an existing skill is sufficient, reuse it. Do not create a duplicate acquisition job.

### 2. Start autonomous acquisition

Only when search is insufficient:

- `alexandria_start_skill_acquisition(prompt=..., project=..., search_snapshot=...)`

The requesting agent does **not** select a provider, profile, OAuth token, model, or completion route. Alexandria selects an executable provider internally and runs the acquisition job in the background.

The acquisition job should:

1. research the missing capability;
2. prefer official documentation, primary repositories, standards, and first-party examples;
3. distinguish verified behavior from inference;
4. produce claim-linked evidence;
5. draft a reusable skill with environment/tool constraints and safety notes;
6. publish the skill to canonical Obsidian storage;
7. reindex and verify the saved artifact;
8. persist a resume handoff for the requesting agent.

If evidence is insufficient, the job must become review/failed state rather than invent sources or silently activate an unverified skill.

### 3. Poll the durable job

Use:

- `alexandria_skill_acquisition_job_status(job_id=...)`

A successful terminal result should provide the durable skill handle/path, verification state, evidence references, and a concise handoff explaining how the requesting agent should resume its blocked task.

There is no public manual-completion tool. Publication and completion belong to the acquisition runner.

## Evidence and activation rule

A reusable skill should not become trusted merely because a model produced text. Require, where applicable:

- authoritative evidence references;
- current environment/version assumptions;
- required tool names;
- reproducible usage steps or examples;
- safety/risk constraints;
- duplicate search before publication;
- successful canonical save and read-back;
- index/search verification after publication.

## Alexandria Core operations

For ordinary library work, use Core tools instead of Librarian delegation:

- `alexandria_search_vault`
- `alexandria_read_note`
- `alexandria_get_related_notes`
- `alexandria_create_note`
- `alexandria_update_note`
- `alexandria_upsert_note`
- `alexandria_vault_review_queue`
- `alexandria_vault_review_move_plan`
- `alexandria_vault_review_apply_moves`
- `alexandria_vault_inventory`
- `alexandria_vault_path_search`
- `alexandria_vault_move_plan`
- `alexandria_vault_apply_moves`

Vault maintenance is not Librarian skill acquisition.

## Memory Steward boundary

Memory lifecycle is separate from the Librarian:

- temporal reconciliation and conflict handling;
- Memory Compact review/promotion/archive;
- periodic compaction;
- memory readiness and lifecycle maintenance.

A Librarian-created skill may emit durable Context/evidence that Memory Steward later compacts, but the Librarian does not own the compaction lifecycle.

## Safety

Never persist secrets, OAuth tokens, device codes, raw credentials, or transient provider logs in Skill notes or handoffs. Provider/OAuth setup belongs to the connection-management boundary, not the requesting agent.
