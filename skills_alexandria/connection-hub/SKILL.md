description: Use when connecting or repairing Alexandria-Hermes OpenAI Librarian OAuth or an MCP client through the local /connect page, including token refresh, reconnect guidance, pairing-code generation, and secret-safe connection verification.

# Connection Hub

Use Alexandria's local connection page instead of manually handling OAuth
tokens.

## Safety boundary

- Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/connect` from the same machine as the backend.
- Do not paste access tokens, refresh tokens, device codes, or pairing codes into
  Obsidian notes, chat transcripts, logs, or source files.
- Pairing codes are short-lived and one-time use.
- Do not expose the local page publicly without HTTPS and operator
  authentication.
- Treat Librarian OAuth as optional; core memory and local retrieval must remain
  usable without it.

## Preflight

```bash
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8000/health/live
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8000/connect/status | jq
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8000/operations/readiness | jq
```

Require `local_only=true`. For MCP browser authorization, require
`mcp_auth_mode=local_oauth2` and `mcp_oauth_enabled=true`.

When a public tunnel or domain fronts the local backend, configure both values
to the same stable public origin before connecting ChatGPT:

```bash
SERVICE_MCP_OAUTH_ISSUER=https://alexandria.example
SERVICE_MCP_OAUTH_RESOURCE=https://alexandria.example/mcp
```

Restart the backend and verify that protected-resource and authorization-server
metadata advertise only public HTTPS URLs. A localhost `registration_endpoint`
causes remote clients to report that RFC 7591 registration is unsupported even
when `/register` itself is implemented.

## Connect OpenAI Librarian

1. Open `/connect`.
2. Select **OpenAI 연결 시작**.
3. Complete the OpenAI device authorization in the opened HTTPS page.
4. Return to the hub and select **연결 확인**.
5. Confirm the Librarian status becomes connected.

Interpret public OAuth status without requesting token material:

- `pending` / `next_action=poll`: finish browser approval, then poll.
- `refresh_required` / `next_action=refresh`: run token refresh.
- `expired`, `missing_refresh_token`, or `reconnect_required=true`: start OAuth
  again.
- `connected` / `next_action=none`: no action is required.

If refresh fails, re-read status. Reconnect when instructed instead of repeatedly
submitting the old refresh request.

## Connect an MCP client

1. Copy the MCP Endpoint displayed by `/connect`.
2. Register that endpoint in the MCP client.
3. When the browser approval page opens, generate a one-time pairing code from
   the hub.
4. Enter the code only in the local approval page.
5. Complete OAuth authorization and verify MCP tool discovery.

Do not generate multiple codes preemptively. Generate a new code only after the
previous code expired or was consumed.

## Verification

After connection:

```bash
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8000/connect/status | jq
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8000/operations/readiness | jq
```

Confirm:

- no credential material appears in either response;
- core readiness remains `READY`;
- retrieval remains `HYBRID` when embeddings are healthy;
- Librarian failures do not disable core memory;
- the MCP client can discover Alexandria tools only after authorization.
