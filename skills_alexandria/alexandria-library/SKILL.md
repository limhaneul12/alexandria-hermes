# Alexandria Library

Use Alexandria as an optional local-first knowledge library for Hermes.

## When to use
- Search local/current context before asking the user to repeat prior decisions.
- When local/current context is insufficient, read the current Memory Compact
  before deeper Context Vault recall/RAG.
- Recall project decisions, compact handoffs, skill candidates, prompts, and usage notes.
- Expand from a relevant seed note through the optional Neo4j related-note graph when direct search is not enough.
- Acquire a missing skill through Hermes-alone fallback first; ask a librarian only on explicit user request.

## Policy contract
- Check `~/.hermes/alexandria-hermes/policy.yaml` or run `alexandria-hermes hermes policy status` before assuming Alexandria is enabled.
- If the policy says `enabled: false`, do not use Alexandria unless the user asks to turn it back on.
- Users can opt out with `alexandria-hermes hermes policy disable` and re-enable with `alexandria-hermes hermes policy enable`.
- Librarian delegation is optional and should require explicit user request.

## Status/diagnostics
- Use `alexandria-hermes hermes doctor` for local status/diagnostics.
- Prefer MCP tools named `mcp_alexandria_*` when available.
- If MCP is unavailable, fall back to CLI commands such as
  `alexandria-hermes memory-compacts current`,
  `alexandria-hermes context recall`, or backend API calls.

## Operating style
- Treat Alexandria as a helper, not an obligation.
- Long-term memory lookup order: current conversation and Hermes local memory
  first, then current Memory Compact, then Context Vault recall/RAG, then
  library skill/prompt search, then Hermes self-acquisition.
- Treat librarian delegation as separate from memory lookup; use a librarian only
  on explicit user request or stricter local policy.
- Keep writes compact and durable: decisions, root causes, reusable plans, and skill candidates.
- Do not store secrets, transient task logs, or private credentials.

## Graph-aware discovery

Use search to find a relevant seed note before traversing the graph:

1. Run scoped FTS/vector/HYBRID search.
2. Read the best seed note and retain its stable `id` or canonical path.
3. Check `/obsidian/graph/projection/status` when graph expansion is useful.
4. Use `alexandria_get_related_notes(note_id=... | path=...)` to inspect related notes.
5. Read and cite the returned notes before using them as evidence.

The graph is a rebuildable Neo4j read model, not a source of truth. Obsidian
Markdown remains canonical, while SQLite `obsidian_edges` remains projection
source-cache state. If graph projection is disabled or unavailable, continue
with normal scoped RAG and do not simulate graph traversal from SQLite.
Missing or ambiguous targets are reported as counted, non-fatal rebuild issues
and are excluded from the active projection. Use detailed issue output only as a
bounded repair sample, not as the normal graph status payload.

## Safe Agent writes

Treat every update as a read-modify-write operation:

1. Read the current note and retain its `content_hash`.
2. Preserve its stable `id`, canonical path, and applicable scope identity.
3. Send the current hash as `expected_content_hash` when replacing the note.
4. If the backend returns `409 OBSIDIAN_WRITE_CONFLICT`, do not retry blindly.
5. Re-read the note, merge the newer content, and retry with the new hash.

An atomic file replacement prevents partial Markdown, but `expected_content_hash`
prevents one agent from silently overwriting another agent's completed update.

## Scope identity

- `AGENT` writes and recall require the intended `agent_id`.
- `SESSION` writes and recall require the intended `session_id`.
- `PROJECT` writes and recall require the intended `project`.
- Supply `workspace_id` whenever the caller has one.
- Do not broaden a missing identity to `GLOBAL`; fail closed and repair the request.
- Keep each concurrent task on its own database/request session.

After canonical writes, verify the note can be read back and that scoped
FTS/vector/HYBRID recall does not return another agent, session, project, or
workspace.

When a write changes note links or graph-relevant metadata, finish with:

1. vault reindex;
2. embedding soft rebuild when RAG reports missing or stale rows;
3. Neo4j graph projection rebuild when graph projection is enabled;
4. exact search/readback plus one related-note lookup from a known seed.

These maintenance steps are sequential. Retry HTTP `409` after the current
maintenance operation completes. Normal search reads the current index and does
not perform an implicit vault reindex.
