# Obsidian Graph Relation Writeback

## Goal

Make approved `add_graph_links` LangGraph actions mutate the active Obsidian
Markdown note and rebuild the SQLite edge cache.

## Delivery

- Server-side active-note writeback for approved librarian source refs.
- Managed `ALEXANDRIA-LINKS` section refresh via existing relation renderer.
- Deduped `source_refs` frontmatter merge.
- Immediate edge-cache reindex through `save_note`.
- Regression coverage for workflow approval and related-note retrieval.
